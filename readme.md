# dc.nextgroup.run

A simple webapp to show all the next 10 runs available in the DC area

Will consist of two endpoints:

- Weekly runs
- One-off runs

* [x] Register `.run` domain! Ideally generic, and use the subdomain for `dc`
* [ ] Compile a list of runs in DC, in a spreadsheet to start
* [ ] Create API -- Need to figure out how to find the next x runs by weekday
